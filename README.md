# Personal Portfolio in React JS

This repository contains the code for a React JS web-app. I decided to build a personal portfolio/website in React first of all to learn the technology, but also as a side hobby :)

In the process, I used the Github Rest API to fetch my repository and display them as "cards". This little piece of automation gives me the ability to upgrade my portfolio without the need of coding it. To add a new project I can simply add the tag `portfolio` to a repository on my github page and a cover image with path `images/portfolio.png`. 

The website is then hosted via Github Pages.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
